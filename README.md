# emailscraper-discwebhook
A simple email scraper I wrote that takes new emails and sends basic info about them to a Discord Webhook. I am currently using this for my schools emails, when we get them, if they are from the noreply email, they will log to a Discord embed for other students to see in our community Discord server.

# Prerequisites
